  I had the pleasure of working with Nikki and the rest of her amazing team from Eventing this past June.<br>
   Navin was very professional and was always available to handle any of my questions and concerns.<br>
    We had a new office opening celebration and a brand launch which was super challenging to execute.<br>
     Navin listened to all my ideas and worked with me to transform our traditional office space into a fantastic LA themed multi-cultural event.<br>
      To add to the challenge I got injured a few hours before the event and she and her team stepped right in to make sure my vision was executed as planned so I didnâ€™t have to worry. 
      <br>Everyone raved about the event afterwards.

I would definitely recommend Eventing for any special event planning.<br>
 They are the best!<br>
